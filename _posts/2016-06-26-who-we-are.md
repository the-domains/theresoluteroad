Who We Are

The Resolute Road began in 2015\. 

Teya and Sadie, the founders of The Resolute Road, met in 2010 and became fast friends, discovering similar passion for Filmmaking, frolicking through open fields, seeking truth and sharing it in a creative way. After numerous adventures and projects around the country/world, they created The Resolute Road as a platform to share, create and connect.
